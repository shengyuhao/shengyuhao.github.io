I'm a third-year Ph.D. student from [College of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) and [ZJU-UIUC Institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/college), Zhejiang University. My research interests include computer vision and its application on ego-centric video understanding, 3D reconstruction, and multi-object tracking.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gaoang Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoangwang/) of [CVNext Lab](https://cvnext.github.io/) from Zhejiang University. 

You can find my CV here: [Shengyu Hao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum Vitae.pdf).

**Iâ€™m actively seeking a job or a PostDoc opportunity starting in Fall 2024.**
